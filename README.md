- 👋 Hi, I’m @b40deep
- 💚 I'm a big fan of the arts - comics, video games, music, and how they are vehicles of worldviews.
- 👀 I’m curious about how humanity and tech are converging. And morality's place in tech (s/o to Tristan Harris).
- 🌱 I’m currently about to start a PhD in Computer Science with a Human-centered approach @ Swansea Uni.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps people control tech and not the other way round.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Send a letter📧.
