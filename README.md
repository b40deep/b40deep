- 👋 Hi, I’m @b40deep
- 💚 I'm a huge fan of the arts - by that I mean comics, video games, music, and how they are vehicles of worldviews.
- 👀 I’m curious about how cars and tech are converging. And morality's place in tech (s/o to Tristan Harris). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React for front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web/mobile development, games, and ML.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Send a bird🕊.
